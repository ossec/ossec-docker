**Description**

OSSEC HIDS Server v2.9.4

Based on Centos 8, this is the official OSSEC project docker container. Note: this can be easily adapted for RHEL 8 for FIPS-140-2 compliance. 

By default this container will create a volume to store configuration, log and agent key data 
under /var/ossec/data.  Additionally it is configured with a local instance of postfix to 
send alert notifications.

        docker run -d -p 1514:1514/udp -p 1515:1515/tcp --name ossec-server <image>


**Launch with a specified Volume:**
